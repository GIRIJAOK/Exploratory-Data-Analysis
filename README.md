## Project Overview

**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** is the process of analyzing data sets to summarize their main characteristics, often with visual methods. This process helps uncover patterns, spot anomalies, test hypotheses, and check assumptions with the help of statistical graphics, plots, and other tools.

**Feature Engineering** is the process of using domain knowledge of the data to create features (input variables) that make machine learning algorithms work. This can include encoding categorical variables, handling missing values, and constructing new features from the existing ones.

### Key Goals of This Repository:
- To provide hands-on examples of how to perform **EDA** and **Feature Engineering** using real-world datasets.
- To demonstrate how these techniques improve the performance and interpretability of machine learning models.
- To showcase best practices for handling different types of data, including numeric, categorical, and text data.

## Key Concepts

### 1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

EDA is the first step in understanding a dataset. It involves:
- **Data Summarization**: Calculating basic statistics such as mean, median, standard deviation, and percentiles.
- **Visualization**: Using plots like histograms, box plots, scatter plots, and pair plots to visualize data distributions and relationships.
- **Outlier Detection**: Identifying data points that are significantly different from the rest.
- **Correlation Analysis**: Understanding relationships between variables using correlation matrices or scatter plots.

### 2. **Feature Engineering**

Feature Engineering involves the process of selecting, modifying, and creating new features that can enhance the performance of machine learning models:
- **Handling Missing Data**: Dealing with missing values using imputation techniques or removal strategies.
- **Categorical Encoding**: Converting categorical features into numerical ones using techniques like one-hot encoding or label encoding.
- **Feature Scaling**: Normalizing or standardizing features to ensure they are on the same scale.
- **Feature Creation**: Creating new features based on existing ones (e.g., combining two features into one or extracting information from date-time variables).

## Installation

To get started, you need to have the following Python libraries installed:

- **pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **numpy**: For numerical operations.
- **matplotlib**: For data visualization.
- **seaborn**: For statistical data visualization.
- **scikit-learn**: For machine learning preprocessing tasks (e.g., scaling, encoding).

You can install these dependencies using `pip`:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

Additionally, if you plan to run the notebooks, make sure you have Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab installed:

```bash
pip install jupyterlab
```
### 2. Open the Notebooks

After cloning the repository, navigate to the directory containing the notebooks and scripts. Open any of the Jupyter notebooks to explore the EDA and feature engineering steps.

For example:

```bash
cd Exploratory-Data-Analysis-Feature-Engineering
jupyter notebook
```

Once Jupyter is open in your browser, you can access the notebooks and start experimenting with the techniques.

### 3. Run the Scripts

This repository includes Python scripts that are designed to work with different datasets. You can run the scripts to:
- Perform data exploration.
